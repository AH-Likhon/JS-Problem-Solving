/*
Undefined: undefined is a fault by debveloper.
1. Variable value not assigned
2. function but didn't write return
3. just wrote return but didn't return anything
4. parameter that isn't passed
5. propery that doesn't exist in an object
6. accessing array element out of range
7. accesing deleted array element
8. explicity set value to undefined

null: null is set by developer which mean the value is not yet on hand.

Diffrenece: In JavaScript, undefined is a type, whereas null an object. It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value. Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.
