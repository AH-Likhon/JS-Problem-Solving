1. Javascript is a dynamic type programming language.


2. Javascript has 7 types of data type
	 #number
	#string
	#boolean
	#undefined
	#null
	#object
	#symbol

Js has 2 border category for data types

### Primitive Data Type- (Primitive Data Type is immutable)
 	#number
	#string
	#boolean
	#undefined
	#null
	#symbol

### Non Primitive Data Type
	#object

3. /*
Falsy:
false, 0, empty string, undefined, null, NaN

Truthy: true, any number (positive or negative), any string including single whitespace, '0', 'false', [], {}

Summary: Anything else that is falsy will be truthy
*/


4. /*
Undefined: undefined is a fault by debveloper.
1. Variable value not assigned
2. function but didn't write return
3. just wrote return but didn't return anything
4. parameter that isn't passed
5. propery that doesn't exist in an object
6. accessing array element out of range
7. accesing deleted array element
8. explicity set value to undefined

null: null is set by developer which mean the value is not yet on hand.

Diffrenece: In JavaScript, undefined is a type, whereas null an object. It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value. Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.

5. /*
== which works implicitely/hiddenly that means first it converts anything into value and then check only value. It doesn't check type.
===(Most of the time it is use for primitive data types) it's directly check both value and type.
*/

6. let, const are used in block scope.

7. Closure: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
